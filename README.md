# Segmentor
This is an implementation of DeepLab v3 (Chen et al., 2017 https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587) on TensorFlow 2.0 on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset (http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/)

# Who are we?
- Adi Nugraha (https://github.com/adinrh)
- Jarmila Ruzicka (https://github.com/Ruzick)
- Francisco Zenteno Smith (https://github.com/fjzs)

# Purpose:
- Implement and train a DeepLab v3 model from scratch
- Use an optimized training pipeline, particularly with the API from TensorFlow 2.0 (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset)
- Compare this implementation to the pre-trained models available on TensorFlow Hub (https://tfhub.dev/s?dataset=pascal-voc-2012&module-type=image-segmentation)
- Deploy the application on AWS to test images uploaded by anyone
- Analyze ethical considerations in the dataset
